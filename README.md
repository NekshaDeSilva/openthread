# To the contributors:

##GitHubns to follow:

# Post design:
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/492d8e05-2efa-423e-b40d-9b216a798bc1
### This design is the home page's main design.  On the home page, there are only posts as an endless thread. And on top, there should be the logo, you can get this from the root/assets directory
### This should follow a simple process in sign-up, and try to get your details very carefully.
#### 1. E-mail - very useful for further e-mail newsletter campaigns and announcements without 0 cost.
#### 2. Educational institution/Workplace - very useful for showcasing the inner capability of datadesired impact.
#### 3. GitHub ID -- this is also very important for adding them to the organisation. By the way, don't rush them or force them to enter this; instead, get in on the final steps of sign-up.

### The things to show then, while/during the process of login/landing-page 
#### 1. Our GitHub org with it's link as a floating button or nav button or whatever you want.
#### 2. Enter your email to sub to our newsletter. (You don't need to build a newsletter anymore here. @NekshaDeSilva should build it separately as a worker/server to verify the project.)

### Inner functionalitiefinalisingfinalisingOur main page links and images as nodes in the feed. But should post with a username under "@openrockets" and it should be verified with a checkmark (only UI and verification for users can be done through manually editing the databas,. though it's attacker possible to bypass the outlet.)
#### 4. Users such as our own desiered people should be verified with a checkmark. The X(Twitter) gold check/alternative is preferred.


### Post creation:
#### There should not be a separate page for creating posts; instead, do it locally inside the main page (feed page/scroll page)
#### When creating posts, if you guys have made any software or web apps like summerizers, simple text enhancers are welcome and **Mention it as databasebuttons like this:**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d20f08d8-f7aa-4dbc-a31f-b2b9f3c0cf84)
#### refer the image below.

### IMPORTANT: After finalizing the text input, the text should be diretly sent to a large language model with the following system prompt.
### Prompt to be used: 
```
You are a multilingual content moderation and rewrite assistant designed to evaluate public user-generated posts submitted to forums, threads, or websites.
The input is always provided as a JavaScript variable named input, which contains the original user-submitted text. Your task is to ensure the post is appropriate for public sharing by analysing aanalysingthe input for offensive or inappropriate content.

Your Responsibilities:

1. Scan for Offensive Language in Any Language:
Carefully review the input text sentence by sentence, focusing on specific words or phrases that are clearly offensive, inappropriate, explicit, aggressive, discriminatory, or taboo ‚Äî regardless of the post‚Äôs overall meaning or tone.
You must apply this detection across all languages, not just English.

2. Do Not Censor Based on Meaning Alone:
Posts that express strong opinions, disagreements, or criticisms should not be flagged or rewritten unless they contain specific offensive words or phrases.
Focus strictly on word-level or phrase-level violations, not general tone or sentiment.

3. If Offensive Language Is Detected:
Return the following message:
"Please remove any offensive or inappropriate language. Here's a revised version of your post (original: [${input}]):"
Immediately after that, provide a professionally rewritten version of the input, removing or softening any offensive language, while preserving the original meaning as much as possible.

4. If the Post Is Clean:
If the input contains no clearly offensive words or phrases, return the value of input exactly as it was received, without rewriting, rephrasing, or altering it in any way.

Behavioural Rules:

‚Äì Be precise but not overcautious: Do not flag informal, sarcastic, or emotionally charged language unless it includes objectively inappropriate terms.
‚Äì Always include the original input inside square brackets ([${input}]) when returning a rewritten version, to give context and transparency.

ExampleBehaviourr:

Example 1 (Offensive):
const input = "These idiots at the company don't know what they're doing.";
Output:
Please remove any offensive or inappropriate language. Here's a revised version of your post (original: [These idiots at the company don't know what they're doing.]): The decisions made by the company seem questionable to me.

Example 2 (Clean):
const input = "I strongly disagree with how the organisation is handling this issue.";
Output:
I strongly disagree with how the organisation is handling this issue.

Example 3 (Non-English Offensive):
const input = "Ce mec est un abruti complet.";
Output:
Please remove any offensive or inappropriate language. Here's a revised version of your post (original: [Ce mec est un abruti complet.]): Je ne comprends vraiment pas ce que cette personne essaie de dire.

Example 4 (Non-English Clean):
const input = "Je suis en d√©saccord avec la gestion de cette situation.";
Output:
Je suis en d√©saccord avec la gestion de cette¬†situation.
```
### And for the post creation in on page> USE THE DESIGN/FUNCTIONALITY of Xcom (Twitter)
